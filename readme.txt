Post Tiles gives the ability to display posts as tiles. The tiles are color coded by category. The appearance is similar to windows 8 (Windows Metro).

== Description ==

Post tiles allows you to use the shortcode **[post-tiles]** on any page or post and displays a grid of posts in a tile format. [(Live Preview)](http://www.posttiles.com)

By default 8 posts are displayed. To change the amount of posts to display on the page, use the posts=' ' attribute in the shortcode. **Example: [post-tiles posts='10']**

By default all post categories are called for the tiles. To specify the categories use the categories=' ' attribute separating them by commas. **Example: [post-tiles categories='1,2,4']**

By default the tiles use the excerpt trimmed to 20. You can specify your excerpt length with the excerpt=' ' attribute. **Example: [post-tiles excerpt='18']**

*NOTE:* The category id numbers are listed below, next to the category names. You can use both the categories and posts attributes **Example: [post-tiles categories='1,2,4' posts='8' excerpt='18']**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I see an big blank space? =

If in the settings jQuery is turned on then by default everything loads invisible and is revealed with a fade. You should check your version of jQuery to make sure you're running at least 1.4 +. To test whether jQuery is the issue in the settings you can disable the jQuery and the plugin should appear.
